Massive Dynamic Dictionary
---------------------------

Provides the following features:

-Provides localization and globablization.
-Allows anyone to create a new word.
-Allows anyone to delete a word unless protected.
-Allows for a word and its definition to be protected.
-Updates this repository with new words at least once a month.
-Anyone can join this repository to add new words or definitions.
-New words can be for a specific language or multiple languages.
-Most words will be for a single language when they first start out for simplicity.
-Add ons will be secondary to words and definitions through an add on interface.
-All entries will consist of a sorted array by dictionary name in a special format.  See appx A.
-New words and definitions added should start with a word have a dash and end with a period.
-Each new candidate word and definition will be added unless it has a competing word and definition.  If it does have a competiting word and definition then it must be rated and ranked before being added to the repository.


All add ons will consist of a separate interface:

-Pronunciation
-History
-Morphology
-Crossword Helpers
-Ratings
-Vulgarity Scale
-Usage
-Imagery
-Word Scramble
-Random word selectors
-Fonts

Appx A.  Format for word defintion entry.

Word - Defintion

Example:
Walking - A mode of locomotion using ones legs as a means of self transportation.
Run - A faster mode of locomotion than walking during the period that effort is expended by using ones legs as a means of self transportation.


Another Example:
Definition - An explanation of a key word.  

Notice that it is not assumed during this phase that a definition is a verb or a noun or even an adjective or adverb.  All of these will be tacked on through a separate interface called usage.  This way long lists of words and their definitions can be added to a system quickly, sorted, and then their usages can be applied at some later date by a cadre of individuals.

Also notice that there is no pronunciation, history, or morphology.  Anything besides a word and a definition are considered through a seconary process using a stanard interface.

You can have more than one definition for a word.  Each definition can be rated and used. Words and their definitions will be given ratings over time and will be dropped when competing words and defintions win out and space constraints demand a recalibration.  No word can sustain a high rating until it is protected.  This process will be a burn in phase.
